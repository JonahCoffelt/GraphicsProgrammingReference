# Graphics Programming Techniques
A collection of notes for various graphics programming techniques and paradigms

## Usage
This repo contains a number of examples. Use CMake to run these examples from source.

```bash
cd ./examples/build

cmake ..
```

This process will download all of the required dependencies to the build folder. This may take a few minutes. Once it has finished, you can build the executables. 

```bash
cmake --build .

```

Then simply run the desired example:

```bash
./example
```
